    "Notice that the distribution is extremely skewed, which is natural considering that fraudulent transactions make up a tiny part of all transactions. Thus we should somehow address the class imbalance. There are many approaches for this, such as weighting the loss function, over- or undersampling, creating synthetic data, or modifying the decision threshold. In this example, we'll use the simplest method which is to just supply a class weight parameter to our learning algorithm. The class weight will affect how much importance is attached to each class, which in our case means that higher importance will be placed on positive (fraudulent) samples."
